# can-parse-csv

This is a simple example of how to parse a CSV file in js. It uses the [csv-parse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csv-parse) package. 

**Note: the content of the page mentions vite, but this project doesn't actually use vite. If you'd like to see an example that does take a look at [can-parse-csv](https://github.com/hcientist/can-parse-csv)**
